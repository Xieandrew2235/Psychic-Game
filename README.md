# Psychic-Game

In this assignment we were able to choose between the Hangman game and the Psychic game. I tried out the Hangman game first because it was the recommended assignment, while simultaneously working on the Psychic game. 

The Hangman game didn't go too well because I got stuck on the part where prompts were showing asking for letter guesses instead of the game being played on the webpage itself. 

For the Psychic game, how it works is that the user is going to have 10 tries to try and guess the letter that is randomly generated, with a loss given if the user fails to guess the letter in 10 tries, or a win if the user guesses within 10 tries. The random letter will reset at the end of each game, and previously guessed letters will also be displayed on the screen. 

For the css, I added a background image and also a picture of a gorilla, who is the psychic. This project was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## How this game was created
* Variables
* Console logs
* Event.key which is when a designated key(s) is pressed to start the game
* With "if" and "else if" statements, we were able to manipulate the variables that showed up on the screen and how they should change as the game goes on.

### What I could have done better

I feel that the page would look better if I put the image and the text into a row, split into two "col-md-6", which I did try to do but couldn't get it to work with the limited time I had left after finally finishing the functionality part of the game. There are also alot of things I could have done on the style.css sheet that would have made the game look better.
